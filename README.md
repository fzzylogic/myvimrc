Backup of vimrc

- Install gvim if you want fancies

  `$ sudo apt-get install vim-gtk`
  
- Install vundle for plugin management (forked it and just added --depth 1 for speed). Maybe one day github will offer auto-pull.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/fzzylogic/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
  
- Compile YouCompleteMe if you want code completion. Instructions at https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.

- Install the silver surfer if you have lots of code to search

  `$ apt-get install silversearcher-ag`

- Launch vim/gvim

- Run vundle to download the plugins

  `:PluginInstall`
  
  Enjoy using your customised version vim/gvim.
